<h3>Why is Bevo Media Free?</h3>
<p>

By far the most asked question we get, and the answer is quite simple - The
best way to build a popular, highly regarded online company is to mold a
revenue model that is based off of providing your product to the userbase
for free (ie: Google). That being said, as a business there obviously needs
to be a revenue model to sustain costs and continue to provide good service.



<br /><br />

So what is our revenue model exactly? The Bevo Media keyword tracker is and
will aways be free. Bevo does as much as it possibly can to offer free
services to its usersbase. Of course, the nature of Bevo’s business model
causes Bevo to incur inevitable fee’s such as server chargers, API usage
fee’s and constant programming to maintain usability and accuracy. So, Bevo
has come up with a reasonable price to ensure that these costs are covered.
Users can enjoy certain Bevo features for free, and will have the option
to pay a licence fee to access our premium features.


<br /><br />

Within the interface, Bevo offers users the option to upgrade to verify
their account. Verifying a Bevo account means you will have access to the
entire interface. The core functionality of Bevo Media will always be free
in the non-verified capacity. Given the landscape of the industry, we have
made it a point to make our interface as free to the user as possible, and
feel that the usage revenue model is extremely fair and beneficial, on both
ends.

<br /><br />

Additionally, Bevo Media is supported by our partnered networks, who pay a
yearly fee to be on our interface. This, on top of our referrals,
marketplace and mentorship program integration, helps Bevo Media provide a
top tier platform to better the internet marketing industry.

<h3>How Do I Know My Data is Secure?</h3>
<p>
We go above and beyond to make sure your data is 100% secure. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. We are well aware that one of the fastest ways our business could fail would be if we were careless about our data security. Before I go forth and tell you all of our methods to ensure your security, the most important aspect to this topic is... 
<br /><br />
Simply put - If you have any ounce of worry about your data security, just use our Self Hosted version! 
<br /><br />
We offer our self hosted version for this very reason. With our self hosted version, your data is stored on your own local machine and databases, ensuring that you are the only person with access to your data. Our regular hosted version of BeVo Media is mainly targeted for our beginner and cost sensitive publishers, while our self hosted version was designed for our experienced high volume, security concerned publishers. We have worked hard to ensure that all of the bases are covered within this issue. 
<br /><br />
Likewise, we have done every step humanly possible to ensure that your data is secure on our hosted version, mainly by creating a legal terms of service. 
<br /><br />
Our user end agreement clearly states that no keyword or traffic source related information will be used or observed by anyone on the Bevo Media team. It is not required for us to have a this in our terms of service, however, if a company does have one, they must abide by it to the fullest extent. Violating your own terms of service is major security offense and is considered a federal violation by the state of law. We would not have created such a strict terms of service if we didn't truly comply with what it states, and put ourselves at risk for no reason. That being said, I thought it was important to point out these rules to our users, and make it clear that we do, in fact, have a legal obligation to make sure their data is secure. If you take a look at some of our competitor's privacy policies and terms of use, they do not address this issue, meaning they are technically free to do as they want with your data. BeVo Media, on the other hand, goes above and beyond to ensure our publishers have the reassurance that their data is safe. 
<br /><br />
If there are any questions, or any other ideas of how we can prove to our users that their data is 100% safe, please email me personally at <strong><a href="mailto:ryan@bevomedia.com" target="_blank">ryan@bevomedia.com</a></strong>.  Your security is of the utmost importance to our company. <br> <br>
