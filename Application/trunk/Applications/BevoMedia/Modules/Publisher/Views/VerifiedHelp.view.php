<h3 id="Meaning">What does it mean to be verified</h3>

An unverified account gives you access to the most basic Bevo Media
features, and offers limited functionality. To take full advantage of the
Bevo Interface, please verify your account. It only takes a minute!
	
<br /><br />

With a verified account, users can track keyword and campaign performance with exact revenue and expense data. Verified Bevo users can auto-sync all of their Network Stats, access the Premium Research Tools and view and retrieve their specific network offers. Also, users gain optimum use of the analytics and PPC management pages as all stats will sync automatically.
