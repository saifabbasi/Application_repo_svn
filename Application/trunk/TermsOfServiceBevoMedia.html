		<p>This Affiliate Program Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between BeVo Media, LLC ("BeVo Media" or "we"), and you, ("you" or "Affiliate") the party submitting an application to become a BeVo Media affiliate. The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement apply to your participation with www.BeVoMedia.com ("Affiliate Program"), and its partnered affiliate networks ("Partners"). Each Affiliate Program offer may be for any offering by BeVo Media or Partners and may link to a specific web site for that particular offer ("Program Web Site"). Furthermore, each Affiliate Program may have additional terms and conditions on pages within the Affiliate Program and are incorporated as part of this Agreement.
