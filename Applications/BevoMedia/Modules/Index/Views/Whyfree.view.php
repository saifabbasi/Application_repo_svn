<h3>Why is Bevo Media Free?</h3>
<p>
By far the most asked question we get, and the answer is quite simple - The best way to build a popular,

highly regarded online company is to mold a revenue model that is based off of providing your product to

the userbase for free (ie: Google). That being said, we have developed a revenue model that can sustain

our costs from other areas not at the expense of our userbase.


<br /><br />
 

So what is our revenue model exactly? The BeVo Media platform is free to all users in the hosted variety.

The self-hosted version of the software offers premium support and all access to Bevoâ€™s Premium

features. Within the interface, Bevo offers users the option to upgrade to a premium account status that

includes an unlimited API call limit, access to our self-hosted soluation. premium technical support and

access to all additonal premium features. The core functionality of Bevo Media will always be free with

a limited number of free API calls. Given the landscape of the industry, we have made it a point to make

our interface as free to the user as possible, and feel that the usage revenue model is extremely fair and

beneficial, on both ends.


<br /><br /> 

Additionally, Bevo Media is supported by our partnered networks, who pay a yearly fee to be on our

interface. This, on top of our referrals, marketplace and mentorship program integration, helps Bevo

Media provide a top tier platform to better the internet marketing industry.

<h3>How Do I Know My Data is Secure?</h3>
<p>
We go above and beyond to make sure your data is 100% secure. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. We are well aware that one of the fastest ways our business could fail would be if we were careless about our data security. Before I go forth and tell you all of our methods to ensure your security, the most important aspect to this topic is... 
 <br /><br />
 
Simply put - If you have any ounce of worry about your data security, just use our Self Hosted version! 
 <br /><br />
 
We offer our self hosted version for this very reason. With our self hosted version, your data is stored on your own local machine and databases, ensuring that you are the only person with access to your data. Our regular hosted version of BeVo Media is mainly targeted for our beginner and cost sensitive publishers, while our self hosted version was designed for our experienced high volume, security concerned publishers. We have worked hard to ensure that all of the bases are covered within this issue. 
 <br /><br />
 
Likewise, we have done every step humanly possible to ensure that your data is secure on our hosted version, mainly by creating a legal privacy policy. 
 <br /><br />
 
Our privacy policy clearly states that no keyword or traffic source related information will be used or observed by anyone on the Bevo Media team. It is not required for us to have a privacy policy, however, if a company does have one, they must abide by it to the fullest extent. Violating your own privacy policy is major security offense and is considered a federal violation by the state of law. We would not have created such a strict privacy policy if we didn't truly comply with what it states, and put ourselves at risk for no reason. That being said, I thought it was important to point out these rules to our users, and make it clear that we do, in fact, have a legal obligation to make sure their data is secure. If you take a look at some of our competitor's privacy policies, they do not address this issue, meaning they are technically free to do as they want with your data. BeVo Media, on the other hand, goes above and beyond to ensure our publishers have the reassurance that their data is safe.
 <br /><br />
If there are any questions, or any other ideas of how we can prove to 
our users that their data is 100% safe, please email me personally at <strong><a href="mailto:ryan@bevomedia.com" target="_blank">ryan@bevomedia.com</a></strong>.  Your security is of the utmost importance 
to our company. <br /> <br />
